### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here on Github, you can see how I have contributed to my original programs ðŸŒ±, as well as others' programs ðŸ‘¯.

<p>
A Pull Request that I feel proud of is my contribution 
to Gitea, which is an alternative to Github itself:

<a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3766">
https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3766
</a>
<p>
<p>
If you like my work, please consider sending 
me a few coins.
